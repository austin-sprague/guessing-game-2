  <h1>Code Fellows Day One Guessing Game</h1>
  <p>Javascript on this page will be for a guessing game.</p>
  <h2>A guessing game?</h2>
  <p>Yes - a three question guessing game about me!</p>

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>

  <h4>Step One: The Prompt</h4>
  <p>The first step asks for the user's name and then saves that into a variable for
    later reference. There will also be a concatenated response that greets the user
    using the new variable.</p>

  <h4>Step Two: The Three Questions</h4>
  <p>There will be three questions about me that will be prompted for the user to answer
    with a Yes or No response. The answer will be saved as variable question1, question2
    and question3.</p>
  <p>The user response will be logged into the console.</p>

  <h4>Step Three: Analysing the Answers</h4>
  <p>After each question, there will be an if/else statement that will analyse whether the user answered the question correctly.</p>
  <p>The if statement will check whether the user's answer equates the correct string. There will be an alert of an immediate feedback to their answer.</p>
  <p>Included is error correction that will turn all the user input into capital letters using the method of .toUpperCase() and will also accept the input of y or n into the prompt.</p>
  <p>Whether the answer is correct or incorrect will be logged into the console.</p>

  <h4>Step Four: Feedback</h4>
  <p>If the user answered correctly, an alert will display a specific and personalised confirmation message. If answered incorrectly, there will be an alert that displays the correct answer in a personalised and specific message.</p>

  <h4>Step Five: Summary</h4>
  <p>The final step gives the user a summary of the answers they submitted correctly. It then thanks them for playing the game.</p>
