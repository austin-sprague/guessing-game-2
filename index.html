  <h1>Code Fellows Day One Guessing Game</h1>
  <p>Javascript on this page will be for a guessing game.</p>
  <h2>A guessing game?</h2>
  <p>Yes - a three question guessing game about me!</p>

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>

  <h4>Step One: The Prompt</h4>
  <p>The first step asks for the user's name and then saves that into a variable for
    later reference. There will also be a concatenated response that greets the user
    using the new variable.</p>

  <h4>Step Two: The Three Questions</h4>
  <p>There will be three questions about me that will be prompted for the user to answer
    with a Yes or No response. The answer will be saved as variable question1, question2
    and question3.</p>
  <p>There will be an alert that reminds the user of the answers that they had submitted.</p>

  <h4>Step Three: Analysing the Answers</h4>
  <p>Once the user has answered the three prompts/questions, there will be three if/else
    statements that will analyse whether the user answered the questions correctly.</p>
  <p>The if statement will check whether the user answer equates the correct string.</p>

  <h4>Step Four: Feedback</h4>
  <p>If incorrect, there will be an else statement that returns to the user that the response was incorrect.</p>
